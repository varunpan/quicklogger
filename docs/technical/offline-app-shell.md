# Offline app shell — internals

## Overview

An offline cold-start — launching the installed PWA or hard-navigating with no
network — used to return a bare `504 "offline"` because nothing HTML-shaped was
ever cached (every route is SSR-only; `prerender = false`). This feature
precaches a single route-agnostic SPA shell and serves it as the navigation
fallback, so the client router boots offline and renders the requested route.
The home loader's one offline-fatal data dependency — the vehicle list — is now
SW-cached, so the log-fuel form is usable offline.

Navigations stay **network-first**: an online cold-start still gets the live
SSR'd page with fresh data. The precached shell is served **only** when the
network fails.

## Files touched

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `src/routes/offline/+page.ts` | `prerender=true; ssr=false` — emits the route-agnostic shell at build time. |
| `src/routes/offline/+page.svelte` | Minimal carrier copy; shown only on a direct `/offline` visit. |
| `src/hooks.server.ts` | `building` guard short-circuits `handle` during prerender (no env, no boot). |
| `svelte.config.js` | `paths.relative = false` — absolute `/_app/…` asset URLs. |
| `src/service-worker.ts` | Precaches `...prerendered`; navigation + `/api/vehicles` branches; `API_CACHE` whitelist. |
| `src/lib/client/sw-cache.ts` | Pure, unit-tested `navigationFallback` + `vehiclesNetworkFirst`. |
| `src/lib/client/cache-warm.ts` | Post-`ready` one-shot `GET /api/vehicles` so SSR'd page loads still warm `API_CACHE`. |
| `src/routes/+page.svelte` | Reactive `online` flag → offline banner + `Save offline` button label. |

## Data model

Two SW Cache Storage buckets are involved (no IndexedDB change):

- `quicklogger-shell-${version}` (existing) — now also holds the `/offline`
  HTML via `...prerendered`. Per-version: pruned and rebuilt on every deploy, so
  the shell HTML always matches the chunks it references (atomic consistency).
- `quicklogger-api-cache-v1` (new, fixed name) — holds the last good
  `GET /api/vehicles` JSON. Fixed name so it **survives deploys** (vehicle data
  must outlive a per-version shell cache) and is whitelisted in `activate`.

`pendingSubmissions` (IndexedDB) is untouched — an offline submit queues exactly
as before.

## Lifecycle / control flow

```text
OFFLINE cold-start
  PWA launch / hard nav to /
    └─► SW fetch handler, req.mode === 'navigate'
          └─► navigationFallback: fetch() throws (offline)
                └─► caches.match('/offline') → precached shell HTML
                      └─► browser loads it AT url "/"
                            └─► kit.start() reads location "/" → renders home route client-side
                                  └─► home loader runs in the browser:
                                        • listVehicles(fetch) → SW /api/vehicles branch
                                              → vehiclesNetworkFirst: fetch throws → API_CACHE hit ✓
                                        • lastFuelup     → /api/* 504 → offline resolver (localStorage/IDB)
                                        • getOcrStatus   → /api/* 504 → catch → camera hidden
                                        • FX             → currency===target → no fetch
                                  └─► form populated; offline banner shown; button = "Save offline"
                                        └─► submit → POST /api/fuelup (SW ignores non-GET) → fetch throws
                                              └─► Queue.enqueue(pendingSubmissions) → "Saved locally" toast
                                                    └─► replays on reconnect (existing sync-queue path)
```

Online navigations skip all of this: `navigationFallback`'s `fetch(req)`
resolves and the SSR'd page is returned unchanged.

## Edge cases & invariants

- **Cold cache offline** (installed but never opened online): `API_CACHE` empty →
  `vehiclesNetworkFirst` returns 504 → `listVehicles().catch(() => [])` → empty
  form (same as today). The first online open fills the cache — via the
  layout's warming fetch (`cache-warm.ts`), **not** the page loader: SSR
  serializes the vehicle list into the HTML, so a full navigation never issues
  a browser `GET /api/vehicles` the SW could see. Without the warming fetch, a
  user whose every session is "launch → log → quit" (full navigations only)
  would keep a cold cache indefinitely (whole-app review #24). Residual: on
  the very first install the warming fetch can bypass the still-uncontrolled
  page; the next launch covers it.
- **Build with no env:** `handle` returns early on `building`, so prerendering
  `/offline` never calls `loadEnv()`. Mandatory — Docker/CI build has no runtime env.
- **Branch ordering invariant:** `/api/vehicles` is matched before the generic
  `/api/*` branch; the navigation branch sits after `/api/*` (a navigation
  pathname is never `/api/…`) and before the generic cache-first branch (so
  precached assets keep being served cache-first).
- **Non-ok responses are not cached:** `vehiclesNetworkFirst` only `cache.put`s
  on `res.ok`, so a 500/502 from upstream never poisons `API_CACHE`. The
  reverse also holds: with a warm cache, a non-ok response is *masked* by the
  cached last-good list (the form stays usable while LubeLogger is down); the
  error only reaches the loader when the cache is cold.
- **Banner is connectivity-driven:** `online` tracks the live `online`/`offline`
  events, so a warm tab that drops its connection also shows the banner — not
  just cold starts. Only the home route renders it.

## Non-obvious decisions

- **`ssr = false` on the shell route** keeps the prerendered HTML data-free, so
  it can boot any route from `location` (SPA-fallback semantics) and the build
  needs no env.
- **`API_CACHE` is a new fixed-name bucket**, not the per-version shell cache and
  not `IMG_CACHE`: shell caches are pruned every deploy (vehicle data must
  survive), and `IMG_CACHE` is image-bytes/SWR-specific (wrong boundary).
- **SW-cache over localStorage** for the vehicle list keeps all offline logic in
  the worker and leaves `+page.ts` / `listVehicles()` untouched — the SW
  intercepts the existing fetch transparently.
- **`controllerchange` reload handshake** (added by whole-app review #7's fix):
  the shell + chunks are precached atomically per version, so a fresh offline
  cold-start is internally consistent — but a tab already open across a deploy
  keeps running the old build's JS while the new SW claims it and prunes the
  old shell cache. `registerControllerReload` (`src/lib/client/sw-update.ts`)
  reloads the page when a controlled page's controller changes, guarded so the
  first-ever claim doesn't reload.

## Testing

- **Unit** — the two cache policies are pure and fully unit-tested in
  `src/lib/client/sw-cache.test.ts`: navigation fallback (online passthrough,
  offline `/offline`-shell fallback, cold-cache 504) and `/api/vehicles`
  network-first (refresh on 2xx, no-cache on non-2xx, cached serve offline,
  cold-cache 504).
- **No Playwright e2e.** The offline cold-start can't be exercised through the
  project's only e2e browser (WebKit / `mobile-safari`): `context.setOffline(true)`
  makes WebKit fail every navigation with an internal error before the SW can
  serve, and a SW `cache.put` that clones a response the loader is concurrently
  consuming doesn't persist in Playwright's WebKit (synthetic puts and the
  install-time shell precache do persist). Both are Playwright-WebKit automation
  artifacts — real iOS Safari runs this standard PWA pattern fine. The end-to-end
  offline path (boot from shell → cached vehicle list → queued submit) is
  validated by manual UAT on a device instead.
